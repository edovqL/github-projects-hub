<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is developed to make it easier for everyone to access and search for information about users and projects on GitHub. With this application, users can search for specific usernames to view detailed profile information, including name, number of repositories, followers, and other available data from GitHub.

In addition, the application allows users to search for repositories using specific keywords. This feature helps users find relevant repositories related to their interests or needs, whether itâ€™s open-source projects, innovative codebases, or ongoing collaborations.

The main goal of this project is to empower users by providing quick and simple access to data and resources on GitHub without the need for manual searching, which can be time-consuming. With a user-friendly and fast interface, this application is designed to assist developers, students, or anyone interested in software development to explore and discover various projects on GitHub efficiently.

Furthermore, this application can serve as an educational tool for learning about the GitHub API and web.
